    "### Project Write-up\n",
    "\n",
    "> - **Code Description** - The code implements an algorithm to estimate the pulse rate for a subject from a given set of ppg and 3-channel accelerometer signals provided for 12 subjects. Specifically, for each subject, we are given one ppg signal and one signal each for the x, y and z channels of the accelerometer. The code fine tunes the heuristic algorithm based on its error with respect to the reference signal given in beats per minute. The code assumes that the pulse rate is restricted to between 40 and 220 bpm. In addition, the code produces a confidence for each estimate. It produces a pulse estimate and confidence output every 2 seconds based on a moving window of 8 seconds of signal, with a 6 second overlap between successive windows, which is how the reference data is specified. The data comes from the Troika dataset (see references), which contains the signal and reference data in .mat format. The code uses scipy.io.loadmat to load these data into Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - **Data Description** - Describe the dataset that was used to train and test the algorithm. Include its short-comings and what data would be required to build a more complete dataset.\n",
    "The data for this project comes from the Troika dataset, with only the PPG and 3-channel accelerometer data retained, and ECG signal discarded, and made available in the .mat format. Per the data description, \"It is recorded from 12 subjects with age from 18 to 35 during fast running at the peak speed of 15 km/h. For each subject, the PPG signals were recorded from wrist by two pulse oximeters with green LEDs (wavelength: 515nm). Their distance (from center to center) was 2 cm. The acceleration signal was also recorded from wrist by a three-axis accelerometer. Both the pulse oximeter and the accelerometer were embedded in a wristband, which was comfortably worn...All signals were sampled at 125 Hz and sent to a nearby computer via Bluetooth\". The signal data files are prefixed with DATA_ while the reference files are prefixed with REF_. The data files have the naming convention: DATA_<subjectID>_<TYPE> where TYPE is TYPE01 or TYPE02 based on how the running speeds changed for participants on the treadmill during the recording. The ground truth files follow the same naming convention, namely REF_<subjectID>_<TYPE>, with one reference file corresponding to each signal file. The reference file contains a variable BPM0 which contains the reference signal, with each entry representing an 8-second signal with a 6-second overlap between successive entries. The data is limited in that it contains a small number of subjects with two types of running schedules only. A more complete real-world dataset is likely to be more noisy, contain an ECG signal and more noise and a larger variety of frequencies in the signals, based on normal human activities such as sitting, standing, reclining, several different types of physical activity and sleep. The test dataset is an unseen dataset, made available for black box testing only. \n",
    "\n",
    "> - **Algorithm Description** - \n",
    "The algorithm works in the following way:\n",
    "1 - Aggregates the 3-channel accelerometer signal into a single \"acc\" signal which is the L2 norm of the 3 channels - square root of the sum of squares of the accx, accy and accz. However, given that the accelerometer y-channel measures gravity constantly, we normalize accy with respect to its mean. In other words, accy = accy - np.mean(accy)\n",
    "2 - Filters the ppg and consolidated acc signal using a bandpass filter which restricts the signal to between 40 and 220 bpm.\n",
    "3 - Iterates through 8-second moving windows with a 6-second overlap, doing the following processing for each window:\n",
    "    (i) Takes the fourier transforms of the ppg and acc signals and sorts the frequencies in descending order of the FFT magnitudes. This gives us the dominant frequencies for the ppg and accelerometer signals.\n",
    "    (ii) If the dominant ppg frequency is greater than the dominant accelerometer frequency by at least 0.1, take the dominant ppg frequency as the heart rate estimate/second.\n",
    "    (iii) Else if the next dominant ppg frequency is not in the top 5 dominant acc frequencies, take this ppg frequency as the heart rate estimate/second\n",
    "    (iv) Else if the next dominant ppg frequency is not in the top 5 dominant acc frequencies, take this ppg frequency as the heart rate estimate/second\n",
    "    (v) If none of the above conditions are true, then simply take the most dominant ppg frequency as the heart rate estimate.\n",
    "    (vi) Compute the confidence by totalling the fft magnitudes for frequencies near the above estimate and dividing it by the sum of the entire magnitude of frequencies for the ppg signal.\n",
    "    (vii) Compute error by taking the difference between the heart rate estimate and reference value for the same window. \n",
    "The ppg measures the pulse rate by measuring the strength of signal as the heart contracts and expands. The accelerometer signal measures the signal based on the physical movement of the subject as they exercise. One limitiation of the algorithm is that the accelerometer frequency may sometimes be confused with the ppg signal, and it may be difficult to distinguish the  two, for example, if the cadence of the arm movement is in line with the heart beating. The ppg signal is also likely to be affected by noise and may pick up other frequencies beyond the heart rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - **Algorithm Performance** - The algorithm is a heuristic one and does not employ machine learning. The algorithm performance is evaluated using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the best 90% of the estimates. We get a MAE of 12.23 on the unseen test dataset. In order to reduce error and generalize on different datasets, we might employ a machine learning algorithm such as Random Forest Regressor. The features used might include the mean, standard deviation and 5th, 10th, 25th, 50th and 90th percentiles of the ppg and each of the accelerometer signals. We may also caution users of the algorithm to consider the effects of noise such as melanin (affects ppg signal) and arm movement, arm position and finger movement (affects acc signal), as well as rapidly changing signals within a small time frame, all of which can affect the performance numbers."
